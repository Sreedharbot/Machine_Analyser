# Machine_Analyser
Documentation of Personal Projects

It is IOT based project. **Boardcasting data from MCU(Microcontroller to Websites)**.


Things learned while covering making these are:
* Using of  ChatGPT.(Making the coding easy and test your solution faster).
* Learned HTTP (POST, GET Protocols) for easy Pushing of data to your website.
* Learned, How to build your own server from scratch using "node.js and also in python*".

I basically, Started my learning in understanding **"Web API"** because, it was very new to me and for this project it was the only necessary part which was mostly needed.

I learned and got my understand, by taking this tutorial from youtube [coding train](https://thecodingtrain.com/) "Beautiful content for learning JavaScripts (beginner)"
